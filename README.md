# Advanced-Algorithmic-Approach-for-Predicting-Urban-Mobility-Threats-Using-NYC-Taxi-Data
Repository: urban-mobility-threat-prediction

Description:

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced algorithmic approach for analyzing and predicting urban mobility threats using New York City taxi trip datasets. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial pattern recognition and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal dynamics to process and analyze large-scale spatiotemporal data. Key features include:

Anomaly detection techniques for identifying outliers in trip durations and geospatial hotspots.
High predictive accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.6838, a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.3989, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4184.
Utilization of TensorFlow and NetworkX for modeling and graph-based data visualization.
Data

The dataset used for this project is in Parquet format due to its large size and complexity. It includes detailed taxi trip records from New York City, capturing both spatial and temporal dimensions essential for the analysis.

Note: Due to the large size of the dataset, it is hosted on Google Drive. You can download the dataset from the following link:
